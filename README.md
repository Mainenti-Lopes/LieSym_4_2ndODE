**Lie Symmetry Condition - 2nd order ODE**

Autor: Mainenti-Lopes, I.



This script calculates the PDEs resulting from applying the Lie symmetry condition to the ODE.

It was developed in the Jupyter Notebook

It uses Lie symmetry group notions to determine the PDEs that must be solved to find the symmetries of the ODE of interest.

It uses the symbolic manipulation library sympy
